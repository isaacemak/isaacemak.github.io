I happend to compile some code to a arm linux platform. But I am not so good at playing with vim. So I plan to edit the code with IDE in my MBA, upload the code via FTP and run them with an ssh to the linux.

First of all I try Filezilla but soon I find some comments that it doesn't supply upload function on script.

Luckily the built-in FTP command meets my need. Just check it out [here][Scripting-ftp-transfers].
